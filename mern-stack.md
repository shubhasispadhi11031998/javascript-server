**WHAT IS MERN STACK?**

MERN is the acronym for MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS. The MERN stack is a combination of the above technologies, all based on JavaScript, used to build advanced web applications. It is an open source full stack development framework i.e. it provides entire front-end to back-end development components. While MongoDB, Express JS and Node JS are the common components (between MEAN and MERN); Angular JS is replaced by React JS in MERN.

**1. MongoDB:**
-MongoDB is an open source, cross platform, NoSql DBMS.
-It is a document oriented database, which means that data is saved using collections and documents, instead of tables and rows, like in a relational database. This makes possible easier and faster data integration within applications.
-MongoDB stores the data in binary JSON format that allows the fast exchange of data between client and server.
-MongoDB can be used for the storage of large volumes of data, which makes it highly scalable.
**2. Express JS:**
-Express JS is a modular, lightweight framework of the Node JS, that helps in building web applications.
-It is a server side, back-end, JavaScript based framework, that is designed to write simplified, fast and secure applications.
-It can be assumed that Express JS, runs on top of the Node JS, managing the server and its routes.
**3. React JS:**
-React JS is an open source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, typically for single page applications.
-React JS enables developers to modify/edit and refresh the page to view the changes without having to restart or reload the page.
-React JS offers the facility of code reusability on multiple platforms.
-It is fast and scalable.
**4. Node JS:**
-Node JS is an open-source, cross platform, JavaScript runtime environment.
-It is designed to run the JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server side.
-Node JS accesses the Node Package Manager (NPM), that hosts a large number of private and public packages, and is as well utilized for publishing Node JS projects.
-It is based on the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

**MERN Stack â€” Advantages**
With MongoDB under its hood for higher scalability, Express JS for speed enhancements, JavaScript as its primary language for end-to-end development, MERN is one of the best full stack development suites after MEAN.
React JS is the best when it comes to UI layer abstraction. It provides the best-in-class tools for faster code development. While React is only a library, it gives you the freedom to build the application and organize the code the way you want, by providing the necessary tools. Hence, it is better than Angular in terms of UI rendering and performance.
