VSCode doesn't offer any built-in interface for opening files directly in the browser. This extension adds a Open With Default Browser item to the contextual menu, as well as command palette options for opening in a client of your choice (Firefox, Chrome, IE).

Quokka is a debugging tool that gives live feedback on the code you are writing. It shows you previews of the results of functions and calculated values for variables. The extension is easy to configure and works out of the box with JSX or TypeScript projects.

Quickly insert placeholder data using the popular Faker JavaScript library. You can generate random names, addresses, images, phone numbers, or just paragraphs of classic Lorem Ipsum. Each category has various subcategories so you can make the data fit your needs.


WIth this extension you can trace the definitions of CSS classes and ids in your stylesheets. When you right click on a selector in your HTML files, choosing the options Go to Definition and Peek definition will send you to the CSS code in which you've styled them.
