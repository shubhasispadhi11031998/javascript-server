**HOW REQUEST GETS SERVED?**

When the server first starts up it performs some initialization and then waits for an HTTP request from a client (such as a browser). When it receives a request, it first selects a virtual server. For details about how the virtual server is determined, see the Sun Java System Web Server 6.1 SP11 Administratorâ€™s Configuration File Reference.

After the virtual server is selected, the obj.conf file for the virtual server class specifies how the request is handled in the following steps:

**ProcedureTo handle request**

**AuthTrans (authorization)**

Verify any authorization information (such as name and password) sent in the request.

**NameTrans (name)**

Translate the logical URI into a local file system path.

**PathCheck (path)**

Check the local file system path for validity and check that the requestor has access privileges to the requested resource on the file system.

**ObjectType (object typing)**

Determine the MIME-type (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Encoding) of the requested resource (for example, text/html, image/gif, and so on).

**Input (prepare to read input)**

Select filters that will process incoming request data read by the Service step.

**Output (prepare to send output)**

Select filters that will process outgoing response data generated by the Service step.

**Service (generate the response)**

Generate and return the response to the client.

**AddLog (adding log entries)**

Add entries to log file(s).

**Error (service)**

This step is executed only if an error occurs in the previous steps. If an error occurs, the server logs an error message and aborts the process.

**Directives for Handling Requests**

The file obj.conf contains a series of instructions, known as directives, that tell the Sun Java System Web Server what to do at each stage in the request-handling process. Each directive invokes a SAF with one or more arguments. Each directive applies to a specific stage in the request-handling process. The stages are AuthTrans, NameTrans, PathCheck, ObjectType, Input, Output, Service, and AddLog.

For example, the following directive applies during the NameTrans stage. It calls the document-root function with the root argument set to D://Sun/WebServer61/server1/docs. (The document-root function translates the http://server_name/ part of the URL to the document root, which in this example is D://Sun/WebServer61/server1/docs.)

NameTrans fn="document-root" root="D:/Sun/WebServer61/server1/docs"
The functions invoked by the directives in obj.conf are known as SAFs.
